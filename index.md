# Mongoose Hammer: Rulebook
1. If you're not infected, get in a Mongoose upon spawning. Some maps have Warthogs, they are allowed. 
2. Don't start going as soon as if you're the driver. Honk your horn to offer possible passengers to get on. 
3. If there's not enough vehicles for you, try and become passenger of another vehicle. If all vehicles are completely full, remain unattended. Players that are not in a vehicle will be ignored by the zombies. Do NOT exploit this rule or the game will end and you will be booted from the party. 
4. If a vehicle flips and all players are ejected, the zombie MUST back up to a far distance to give all players a chance to get back into the vehicle.
5. Do not use the Elephant on Hammer Sandtrap.
6. Do not use a Warthog if you are the only un-infected player.
7. Do not play around on the Gravity Lifts on Hammalanche. 
8. If your vehicle is destroyed by the Gravity Hammer, simply go back to the spawn point and get another vehicle, each one has a 10 second respawn rate. As said before, unattended players are ignored by the zombies. 

If you break any of these rules, you will be booted from the party and not considered for future Mongoose Hammer matches.
